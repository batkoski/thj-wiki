Kunark introduces the first expansion ever released to EverQuest. In The Heroes Journey, here's a list of things worth noting about Kunark that are unique to other servers:

In order to access Kunark content, you must finish the [progression requirements](/progression/)

- No new AAs are introduced in Kunark
- No keys are required for Howling Stones (charasis) or Sebilis (this includes zoning INTO these zones, as well as accessing areas inside them)
- To Access Veeshan's Peak, you must kill the 4 dragons of Kunark
- Veeshan's Peak is 1.0 version, making it in line with Kunark era loot
- Legacy of Ykesha zones are unlocked with Kunark, as well as Stonebrunt Mountains, Jaggedpine Forest, ChardokB, and Veksar. Note that Soldungc is NOT unlocked until PoP.
- Legacy of Ykesha gear was reduced to put it more in line with Kunark era loot
- Charms are obtainable in Legacy of Ykesha zones. (They are not amazing, but you can fill the slot now at least)
- You can view items and NPCs found in Kunark inside the [ret allaclone](<https://retributioneq.com/allaclone/?a=zone_era&era=kunark>). This is up to date and in sync with the latest on THJ.
