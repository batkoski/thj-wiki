Key differences for the Bard class on THJ compared to live or other servers:

- Bard beneficial songs do not have to be twisted or refreshed once sung within a new zone, they will remain on your character until you enter a new zone, log, or remove the song from your spell bar
- Bard detrimental songs can be twisted or used with the 'Melody' system like usual
- Bards start level 1 with the following AAs: 'Fading Memories', 'Dance of Blades', 'Jam Fest', 'Harmonious Attack Rank 5', 'Eyes Wide Open Rank 8', 'Mystical Attuning Rank 5', 'Bazaar and Back Gate', 'Consume Item'
- All instrument modifiers are higher than on live
- Custom Bard Epic 1.0 {{<item id="2020542" name="Singing Short Sword" link="/equipment-guide/epics/brd-epic/">}}, available for completion once Kunark is released

## Bard Skills

Skills are autogranted at level 1, and then raised through use, like on live. You may see skills that the Bard shouldn't have when you start (like Kick), but these aren't actually usable and are a symptom of some of the multiclassing elements on the server. If you can put at least 1 point into a skill, then you can use it.
